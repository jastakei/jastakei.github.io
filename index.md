## About Me
### Summary
Currently, I am seeking a software engineering summer internship for the year of 2021. My primary interests and strong foundations are in programming logic, object-oriented design,and computer organization. I am energetic, highly sociable, and passionate about working as a team and as well as independently. If I sound like a good fit, please contact me at **jtakei@ucsd.edu**.  
*My favorite quote is:*
> Ego says once everything falls into place, I'll feel peace. The Soul sys find your peace and then everything will fall into place.

### ~~A C++ Command I guess:~~
```
cout << "Hello, World!"" endl;
```
